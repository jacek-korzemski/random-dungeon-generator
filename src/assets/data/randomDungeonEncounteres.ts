  "A series of handprints smeared across the walls, as if someone was desperately clawing at them.",
  "A faint, eerie chanting sound that echoes through the halls but grows quieter when pursued.",
  "A pile of bones arranged in a circle, with a faintly glowing stone at the center.",
  "A strange, hollow echo that seems to follow the party, even when standing still.",
  "A shadow on the wall that doesn't match any of the players' movements.",
  "A faint heartbeat sound that grows louder as the party approaches a particular doorway.",
  "A room where the temperature drops drastically, causing visible breath, though no source of cold is apparent.",
  "A skeletal figure seated on a throne, its hollow eyes glowing faintly, watching the party.",
  "A faint, raspy breathing sound coming from behind a wall, but nothing is there."
