# Random dungeon generator

Right now, it's simple ASCII dungeon generator in environment that mimics a little classic terminal.
Second mode, generate simple description of random components of a dungeon.

Right now, I'm working with combining the first mode with second, so the map could have descriptive data connected to it.
